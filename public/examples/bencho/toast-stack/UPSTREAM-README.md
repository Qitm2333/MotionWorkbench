## Use it

Copy `ToastStack.tsx` and `ToastStack.css` into your project, and add [`tokens.css`](../../tokens.css) once if you have not already.

```bash
npm install framer-motion lucide-react
```

```tsx
import { ToastStack } from "./ToastStack";
import "./ToastStack.css";

export default function Demo() {
  return <ToastStack />;
}
```

## Props

Every prop is optional and defaults to what the block ships with on bencho.dev.

| Prop | Knob | Default | Range | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `peek` | Peek | `14` | 6–24 px | how much of each tucked toast shows |
| `gap` | Gap | `10` | 4–20 px | the space between toasts once fanned out |
| `corner` | Corner | `20` | 0–32 px |  |

## Tokens it reads

`--fill-on` `--fill-slab` `--font-ui` `--ink` `--pane-edge` `--signal` `--tst-r` — all defined in [`tokens.css`](../../tokens.css). Map them to your own theme if you have one.
